I served as a Research Fellow at University of St Andrews, first with [Prof. Duncan Robertson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T0MqToAAAAAJ) and [Dr. Samiur Rahman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5946qVsAAAAJ) on ML-driven low-altitude airspace safety, and later with [Dr. Juan Ye](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g2K5ofYAAAAJ) on trustworthy LLMs.
I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science  within 2.5 years, from the University of St Andrews, supervised by [Dr. Ognjen Arandjelović](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=D7bpRJ8AAAAJ) and [Dr. Lei Fang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=KVumA5UAAAAJ). I also collaborated closely with [Prof. Chun Pong Lau](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UYMV3qMAAAAJ), [Dr. Yifei Qian](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3hkMMBAAAAAJ), and [Dr. Shuai Zhao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=upbsFBAAAAAJ&hl) during my Ph.D. journey.

My research centers on Trustworthy AI, especially Adversarial Attack and Generative AI Misuse Prevention. I served as a reviewer for numerous prestigious journals and conferences, including *IEEE T-IFS*, *Pattern Recognition*, *Information Sciences*, *NeurIPS*, *ICLR*, *CVPR*, and *AAAI*. I am also the **Leading Guest Editor** for the special issue [Security and Trustworthiness in Pattern Recognition: Attacks, Evaluations, and Defenses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/special-issue/327042/security-and-trustworthiness-in-pattern-recognition-attacks-evaluations-and-defenses) of Pattern Recognition.
